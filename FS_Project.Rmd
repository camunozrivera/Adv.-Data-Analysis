## Objectives 
1.	Determine whether adult food security status associated with citizenship status 
2.	Determine whether child food security status associated with citizenship status 

## Load packages and open libraries 
```{r, echo=TRUE, message = F}
pacman::p_load(odds.n.ends, blorr, lmtest, car,  broom, tidyverse, jtools, dplyr) 
pacman::p_load(readr, nnet, MASS, funModeling, brant)

# tidyverse:data management and visualization
# odds.n.ends: computing sensitivity and specificity, plotting predictive probabilities and ROC curves for logistic regression
# blorr: model fits of logistic regression
# lmtest: likelihood ratio test
# car: compare coefficients
# broom: get cooks d

# readr: for read txt file
# tidyverse: for various packages
# nnet: Multinomial logistic regresison
# MASS: Ordinal logistic regression
# funModeling: for describe function
# brant: for testing parallel regression assumption
```

## Import csv from github
```{r, echo=TRUE}
FS <- read_csv("/Users/alemunoz/Desktop/BrownSchool/Fall22/ADA/FS_data.csv")
```



```{r, echo=TRUE}
#select final interview outcome (HUFINAL), family income (HEFAMINC), age (PRTAGE), race/ethnicity (PTDTRACE), employment status (PEMLR), household size (HRNUMHOU), adult food security status (HRFS12M1), children's food security status (HRFS12MC) and citizenship (PRCITSHP) status. We're throwing in state (GESTFIPS) for fun. 

#Need to figure out how to drop -1 in age & HRNUMHOU (continuous variables).

```

## Check percentage of data excluded
```{r}
nrow(fs2)/nrow(FS) * 100
```
Might be a lot excluded. But not everyone did the food security questionnaire  

## Let's make sure we have enough cases in each exposure/outcome category. 
```{r}
table(fs2$Cit3, fs2$FoodSec, fs2$KidFood)
```
Had to little in each category when citizenship status had 3 or 5 categories. Was recoded into binary (citizen/non-citizen). 

## Run oridinal regression for adult food security 
```{r}
model1 <- polr(FoodSec ~ Cit2, data=fs2, Hess=TRUE) 

summary(model1)

tidy(model1, conf.int=TRUE, exponentiate = TRUE, p.values=TRUE)
```

## Let's adjust for income category and race/ethnicity. 
```{r}
model2 <- polr(FoodSec ~ Cit2 + Inc + Race, data=fs2, Hess=TRUE)
summary(model2)

tidy(model2, conf.int=TRUE, exponentiate = TRUE, p.values=TRUE)
```

The odds of being FS are 1.10 (95% CI 0.97-1.23) times the odds of being non-FS for respondents who are not U.S. citizens. 
#Income
The odds of being FS are 0.79 (95% CI 0.71-0.88) times the odds of being non-FS for respondents who make between $20,000-$39,999. 

The odds of being FS are 0.48 (95% CI 0.43-0.54) times the odds of being non-FS for respondents who make between $40,000-$59,999. 

The odds of being FS are 0.25 (95% CI 0.22-0.28) times the odds of being non-FS for respondents who make between $60,000-$74,999.

The odds of being FS are 0.14 (95% CI 0.12-0.16) times the odds of being non-FS for respondents who make between $75,000-$99,999.

The odds of being FS are 0.07 (95% CI 0.06-0.09) times the odds of being non-FS for respondents who make between $100,000-$149,999.

The odds of being FS are 0.02 (95% CI 0.02-0.03) times the odds of being non-FS for respondents who make more than $150,000.

#Race
The odds of being FS are 1.51 (95% CI 1.38-1.66) times the odds of being non-FS for respondents who are Black. 

The odds of being FS are 1.39 (95% CI 1.11-1.72) times the odds of being non-FS for respondents who are AI/AN. 

The odds of being FS are 1.17 (95% CI 1.00-1.37) times the odds of being non-FS for respondents who are Asian. 

The odds of being FS are 1.09 (95% CI 0.74-1.58) times the odds of being non-FS for respondents who are Hawaiian/Pacific Island.

The odds of being FS are 1.39 (95% CI 0.84-2.19) times the odds of being non-FS for respondents who are Hispanic only.

The odds of being FS are 3.78 (95% CI 2.39-5.81) times the odds of being non-FS for respondents who are 3 or more races.

## Don't have to to test for linearity since non of the variables are continuous.

## Testing the parallel regression/proportional odds assumption using Brant Test for adult food securiyt 
```{r}
brant(model2) #Assumption holds 
```

#Repeat model for kids food security 
```{r}
model3 <- polr(KidFood ~ Cit2 + Inc + Race, data=fs2, Hess=TRUE)
summary(model2)

tidy(model3, conf.int=TRUE, exponentiate = TRUE, p.values=TRUE)
```
